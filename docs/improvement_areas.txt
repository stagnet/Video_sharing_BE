Areas for Improvement:

1. Error handling in the Cloudinary utility doesn't return proper error information
2. The multer middleware has a potential bug using file.filename instead of file.originalname
3. The ApiResponse class has unnecessary parentheses in the constructor
4. There are two AsyncHandler implementations but only one is used
5. Limited API endpoints (only user registration is implemented)
6. No global error handling middleware
7. No input validation middleware
8. No authentication middleware despite JWT token generation in the user model
9. No environment variable validation
10. No logging system beyond console.log
11. No test files or testing framework
12. No documentation beyond code comments
13. No CI/CD configuration
14. No security headers or best practices
15. No rate limiting for API endpoints
