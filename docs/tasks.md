# Node.js Application Improvement Tasks

## Code Quality and Bug Fixes

- [ ] Fix Cloudinary utility to properly handle and return errors
- [ ] Fix multer middleware filename issue (change `file.filename` to `file.originalname`)
- [ ] Clean up ApiResponse constructor by removing unnecessary parentheses
- [ ] Remove or document the unused asyncHandler implementation
- [ ] Add proper error handling for file upload failures in user controller
- [ ] Implement consistent error message format across the application
- [ ] Add input validation for all API endpoints
- [ ] Add proper type checking and validation for function parameters

## Architecture and Structure

- [ ] Implement global error handling middleware
- [ ] Create a centralized logger utility instead of using console.log
- [ ] Implement environment variable validation on application startup
- [ ] Organize routes into logical groups (auth, user, etc.)
- [ ] Create a middleware directory structure for different middleware types
- [ ] Implement a service layer between controllers and models
- [ ] Extract business logic from controllers into service classes
- [ ] Create a config directory for application configuration

## Feature Completion

- [ ] Implement user login endpoint with JWT authentication
- [ ] Implement user profile update endpoint
- [ ] Implement password reset functionality
- [ ] Implement email verification for new users
- [ ] Complete CRUD operations for user management
- [ ] Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- [ ] Add pagination support for list endpoints

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] Implement authentication middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement security headers (helmet.js)
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper password validation rules
- [ ] Add request data sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] Implement IP-based blocking for repeated failed login attempts

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Set up a testing framework (Jest or Mocha)
- [ ] Write unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) pipeline
- [ ] Add linting and code formatting tools
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

## Documentation and Maintenance

- [ ] Create API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions and classes
- [ ] Create a comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document environment variables and their purpose
- [ ] Create database schema documentation
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning for the API
- [ ] Add changelog to track version changes

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement response caching for appropriate endpoints
- [ ] Add database query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for database connections
- [ ] Add compression middleware for API responses
- [ ] Optimize file upload and processing
- [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks
- [ ] Add monitoring and performance metrics collection

## DevOps and Deployment

- [ ] Set up Docker containerization
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for different environments
- [ ] Implement database migration strategy
- [ ] Set up automated backups for the database
- [ ] Configure proper logging and monitoring in production
- [ ] Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy
- [ ] Create infrastructure as code (IaC) for cloud deployment
